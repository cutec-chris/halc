# halc - Hardware Abstraction Layer for Python
halc provides an Hardware Abstraction Layer for Python projects.
It handles dynamically iteration and removal of devices and provides easy to use functions to find and ensure devices presence.
It also provides base [Base Classes](reference.md) to have an abstract layer for different hardware.

# Supported Hardware
[Sensors](sensors/index.md)<br>
[Motors,Servos,Acutators](motors.md)<br>
[Sound](sound.md)<br>
[Video](video.md)<br>
[Networking](networking.md)<br>
